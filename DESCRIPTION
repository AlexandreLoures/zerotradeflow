Description: A system for creating the bilateral trade flow between a country
    pair equal to zero. You provide the data, tell `get_zerotradeflow` which 
    variables are of interest and it expands the base by creating the bilateral
    zero trade flow. The bases on the flow of trade between countries only report
    positive trade (greater than zero), however, for some analyzes of gravitacional
    models, data on zero flow is also necessary.
